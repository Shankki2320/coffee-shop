**This document highlights the design considerations and assumptions being made during the development of the Application**

- Database : postgresql as mentioned in the HRD
- Application type : SpringBoot Application
- Use of Liquibase for database automation
- All standards followed during design and implementation of the APIs
- Created only one microservice as per the requirement specified
- Also, I did not find any specific use case for implementing event driven architecture as the number of APIs is constrained to 2-3 for skills demonstration
